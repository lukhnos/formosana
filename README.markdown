# Formosana: A C++ Library for Processing Taiwanese Languages

This is a C++ library for processing languages spoken in Taiwan. Currently it covers Taiwanese Mandarin, Holo and Hakka. The library has been used in real-life input method and language processing tool development.


## Synopsis

In `Examples/Overview` there is a sample project with a simple Makefile. It should build on most UNIX systems, including Mac OS X. Just type `make` and press enter.

Take a quick look at `MandarinDemo.cpp` and `RomanizationDemo.cpp` and you'll find brief snippets on what this library can do.

For example, you can build Mandarin syllables using the Bopomofo system, and convert the syllable to either composed Bopomofo stirng, or to Hanyu Pinyin:

    // create a Mandarin syllable, compose the "mian4" (face) syllable
    BopomofoSyllable m(BopomofoSyllable::M), i(BopomofoSyllable::I), an(BopomofoSyllable::AN), tone4(BopomofoSyllable::Tone4);

    BopomofoSyllable mian4;
    mian4 += m;
    mian4 += i;
    mian4 += an;
    mian4 += tone4;

    // Output a composed Bopomofo string (UTF-8)
    cout << "mian4 = " << mian4.composedString() << endl;

    // Output a Hanyu Pinyin string
    cout << "mian4 = " << mian4.HanyuPinyinString(true, true) << endl;

Conversions from the reverse direction (composed Bopomofo or Hanyu Pinyin to syllable) are also provided. Note, though, the library currently doesn't take accented form of Hanyu Pinyin. So "lan2" is ok, "lán" is not.

Holo and Hakka languages are supported via a shared class called TaiwaneseRomanization. The design explains further explanation, and please ask me why the class is designed as such. In short, it is aimed for input method development. This being said, it can serve general language processing purposes well. Examples:

    // create a POJ syllable for chioh8 (stone), then convert to TL
    RomanizationSyllable s1;
    s1.setInputType(POJSyllable);    
    s1.insertCharacterAtCursor('c');
    s1.insertCharacterAtCursor('h');
    s1.insertCharacterAtCursor('i');
    s1.insertCharacterAtCursor('o', 8); // enter a tone here
    s1.insertCharacterAtCursor('h');
    cout << "POJ syllable \"" << s1.composedForm() 
        << "\" converts to TL => \"" << s1.convertToTLSyllable().composedForm() << "\"" << endl;
    
    // transforms a composed string back to its normalized database (ASCII) form
    string composedString = "chio\xcc\x8dh"; // chio̍h
    string databaseForm = VowelHelper::queryFormFromComposedForm(composedString);    
    cout << "Composed form \"" << composedString << "\" to ASCII form => \"" << databaseForm << "\"" << endl;

    
    // Converts Hakka "sṳ" (the last syllable in "Pha̍k-fa-sṳ") back to the query form
    string hakkaString = "s\xe1\xb9\xb3";   // sṳ
    string hSQF = VowelHelper::queryFormFromComposedForm(hakkaString);
    cout << "Composed form \"" << hakkaString << "\" to ASCII form => \"" << hSQF << "\"" << endl;


## External Dependencies

This library is designed to be as much self-containing as possible. Still, it comes with a small portion of the [OpenVanilla Framework](http://github.com/lukhnos/openvanilla-renaissance) on which the library depends. The parts really used are UTF-8 helpers, wildcard objects (a simplified regex implementation) and string helpers. No other external dependency is required, and to work with this library, the files presented here are all you need.


## History and Acknowledgment

This project was originated from OpenVanilla's POJ module, first developed in late 2004 with the advice of Professor Pektiong Tan of National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan. In late 2005, Professor Tan and I started revising the module, and had drafted out, in rough BNF notation, a phonetic grammar of the Holo language that could be used in a syllabizing library. The drafted grammar didn't go anywhere, but the rules have been fully incorporated in this library.

In late 2006, the project has evolved into [lib-formosa](http://code.google.com/p/lib-formosa), the immediate predecessor of this project. I started to rework OpenVanilla's Bopomofo module in late 2007, and the result has become the present Mandarin library.

The two components, Taiwanese Romanization support and Mandarin, are finally merged into one coherent code base in early 2010.


## Limitations

While I would certainly like the library to cover as many Romanization systems as possible, the present implementation reflects my limited knowledge in the field (and limited time to work on this project). The library is designed to be highly extendable, so it should be relatively simple to incorporate other Romanization systems and keyboard layouts. I'd be happy to receive your pull requests and fully functional patches.
